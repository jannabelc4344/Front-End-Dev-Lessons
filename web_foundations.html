      <h2>The Internet and Web Development</h2>
        <h3>Overview of the Internet</h3>
          <p>In this lesson you will learn how the internet works behind the scenes. After finishing this lesson, you'll be able to answer questions like:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How is data sent from one computer to another?</li>
            <li>What is the relationship between a browser and a server?</li>
            <li>How is code turned into the experience that users see in their browsers?</li>
            <li>How has the web and web development changed from its invention to today?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In 1969, the United Staes Department of Defense funded the certation of <em>ARPANET</em>, <strong>A</strong>dvanced <strong>R</strong>esearch <strong>P</strong>rojects <strong>A</strong>gency <strong>N</strong>etwork. ARPANET connected supercomputing centers run by government agencies and universities. Institutions wanted to connect their individual netowrks for a large-scale information transfer, however many of them followed different standards and technical implementations.</p>
          <p>In the 1970s, the <em>transmission control protocol</em>, otherwise known as TCP/IP, were created to provide standards around the transfer of data that would allow these early connections to communicate. TCP/IP was researched and specififed throughout the 70s and adopted in the early 80s. </p>
          <p><em>The Intenet</em> refers to he actual network of connected computing devices. Duringthe 80s, there ws no intuitive way to browse the internet, so it was mainly used to send messages from one computer to anotehr. Engagement with the internet changed in 1989, when <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/historical-technical-figures/tim-berners-lee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tim Berners-Lee</a> invented the <em>world wide web.</em> The world wide web is a collection of interlinked websites and other web sources. This introduced a user-friendly interface that allowed uses to browse multmedia content and interactions with other users, which lead to the use of the internet in wider society throughout the 90s.</p>

    <section class='browsers-servers'>
      <h2>Browsers and Servers</h2>
        <p>One way computers send information from one device to another can be referred to as the <em>client-server</em> model. In this model, the <em>client</em> refers to the user's device that is making the request for data, like a browser or application running on a user's laptop, smartphone, or tablet. The <em>server</em> is the device or program in that network that waits for incoming requests and sends back data. This might be an in-house server, a rented server at a data center, or cloud-server.</p>
        <p>For example, Codecademy has servers that store lesson data and their servers are sending this lesson to your client device.</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>What happens when you request a website in your browser?</dt>
          <dd>The request is sent from your device to a server across the internet. The server sends code and data as a response to the browser's request.</dd>
          <dt>What is a Server?</dt>
          <dd>A server is a specialized computer connected to a network which provides, or "serves up," resources or services.</dd>
          <dt>How do Browsers and Servers Communicate?</dt>
          <dd>The browser and server communicate with one another using the Internet Protocol known as HTTP, or <em>hypertext transfer protocol</em>, which allows for data transfer. (When you see an 's' at the end of the HTTP in your browser, that means the connection is secure).</dd>
        </dl>
    </section>

        </table>

    <section class='status-codes'>
      <h2>You've seen status codes before!</h2>
        <p>When the server sent back a response it sends back a status code that accompanies the user's requested resource.</p>
        <p>For example: <strong>404 Status Code</strong></p>
        <p>This is known as an HTTP Status Code that indicates that the requested content wasn't found. HTTP provides reliable structure to the interplay between the client and the server.</p>

              <td>The request resource was not found</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>500 Internal Server Error</td>
              <td>The server encountered an unexpected error</td>

    <section class='browsers'>
      <h2>How do Browsers Work?</h2>
      <p>Every time a webpage is loaded, the client sends a request for each file that makes up that page, so even when we're just loading <em>one</em> webpage that site can make multiple requests in order to retrieve different pieces of content, like images. In a moment, this will happen:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>When a user types in a URL and presses enter, the server processes the request and sends the HTML file back to the client. HTML files hold the content of a website and they also contain links for any additional assets or codes that are needed to display the site properly.</li>
          <li>The browser will begin to search for elements in the HTML file and it will start to make additional HTTP requests for any other external resources used by the HTML file. This often includes:
            <ol type="a">
              <li>One or more CSS stylesheets, also known as cascading style sheet; CSS creates the style and layout of a webpage. The browser will request the CSS stylesheet, and when the server sends it back, the browser analyzes the CSS and starts applying the visual styles to the content of the site.</li>
              <li>The request-response cycle also sends website assets, like images and videos, from the server to the browser. If these files are large, there might even be a noticeable delay before they are rendered by the browser.</li>
              <li>One or more JavaScript files. JavaScript makes the webpage interactive. This programming language functions as the "behavior" of the webpage. A webpage that does not use JavaScript is known as a static webpage.</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>This results in pages where some resources load faster than others, as with most modern browsers. The whole process depends on the speed of the user's connection, the size of the website, and even the physical distance between browser and the server.</p>
    </section>

    <section class='web2'>
      <h2>Web 2.0</h2>
        <p>Statis websites are composed of text, images, links, and very little interactivity beyond browsing from one page to another. Static webpages did not change based on user behavior, but as internet connection speeds and technologies improved, more complex interactions became possible on te web.</p>
        <p>A collection of advances in the early 2000s created a cluster of web applications that is often called "Web 2.0" which are often defined by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Providing a dynamic user experience by offering content that responds to user input without forcing the page to reload. In the early web, a user's input would typically take the user to a new page - and they would have to wait for the new page to load. In Web 2.0, websites could just update selected regions of the page, avoiding the interruption caused by reloading.</li>
            <li>Emphasizing user-generated content and social sharing. In the early web, content was generally authorized by a single source. The rise of blogging, social media, and wikis in the Web 2.0 meant that users could generate content and share it with their friends.</li>
          </ul>

        <p>There were important technical advances in the user interface after the rise of Web 2.0. For example:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><em>jQuery</em> was the first JavaScript framework, or software the provides boilerplate code and functionality for building applications, that could fetch data while the page is still running. </li>
          <li>The rise of <em>web frameworks</em> that connected to databases, like Spring, Django, and Ruby-on-Rails, enabled user-generated content to effectively be created, stored, and displayed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This meant that Web 2.0 pages became more interactive, dynamic, and allowed for social interaction compared to static webpages.</p>

    <section class='currenttrends'>
      <h2>Current Internet Trends</h2>
      <h3>Responsive Web Design</h3>
      <p><em>Responsive Web Design</em> was enabled by additions to the CSS language, like media queries and relative units. These additions allow the presentation of websites to adjust based on the size of the window they are being displayed in.</p>
      <h3>Mobile Applications and Devices</h3>
      <p>Though most mobile applications are internet connected, they are not part of the world wide web. The world wide web is built out of links, whereas mobile applications are designed to keep the user's attention. A majority of mobile applications are built in programming languages such as Swift (for IOS) and JavaScript frameworks.</p>
        <p>Mobile internet traffic and web development practices have evolved in order to provide a good user experience regardless of device types.</p>

        <h2>Review</h2>
          <dl>
            <dt>How is data sent from one computer to another?</dt>
            <dd>The browser initiates a request to the server and renders website files. The server stores website files and sends them to the web browser upon request.</dd>
            <dt>What is the relationship between a browser and a server?</dt>
            <dd>The relationship is client-server based: the browser (client) makes requests to the server over the internet.</dd>
            <dt>How is code turned into the experience that users see in their browsers?</dt>
            <dd>The browser renders HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files returned by the server into the visual experience users see. Status codes (like 200, 404, 500) help indicate how that request is processed.</dd>
            <dt>How has the web and web development changed from its invention to today?</dt>
            <dd>We have moved on from static websites to Web 2.0 where sites are dynamic, interactive, and share the updated information for every user. In more recent years, mobile applications have been making changes in the internet world due to the lack of users using their native phone browser as a means to connect to the internet.</dd>
