      <h2>Who are you?</h2>
        <p>Hello, hi! My name is Alchemy (yes, it is a chosen name) and at the time of making this, I am 26 years old (June bug here). I love video games from card games, table top games, FPS (first-person shooter, and I pride myself on being a decent shot IRL *put me on the spot and I promise I will fail*), arcade games like Galaga or something from Dave & Busters, Stardew Valley, Balataro, roguelikes, RPGs, and more!</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, I am not of the best health, so I knew I had to make some major changes in my life. I started to learn how to properly clean the house, to cook eggs fully, keep myself clean (very important to me!), how to apply makeup, enjoy skincare, and (now) learning programming! Mind you, before that I was trying to learn finance, and although my stocks are doing surprisingly well, it really is just gambling in my mind (lol).</p>
        <p>In the end, after looking back on my past dating experiences and my aspirations as a child, somehow I keep finding myself brought back to coding. After taking a very scuffed class in high school, I found that it came very easily to me, and I loved seeing my work update and evolve in real time. I never had the head for math, heck, I have awful spatial reasoning to boot, but I sure could write some repetitive codes that followed a lot (like too many) rules. The experience reminded me of how I would write my journals that I would spend literal days planning, coloring, adding stickers, and organizing (then re-organizing).</p>

      <h2>What is the purpose of this website?</h2>
        <p>I will be taking the notes I took from Codecademy and turning them into a webpage! I hope for the webpage to evolve with my skills. For now though, this is just practice and a means to build a portfolio (which will hopefully full of fun projects). I am also very excited to see how my webpage develops and changes as I learn more and I hope to look back on these early versions fondly.</p>

      <h2>Additional Notes?</h2>
        <p>If I may be vulnerable: I have never been confident in myself. My health was always up in the air for me. I knew that I got hit in the head and fainted much more than my peers, but I always assumed that my heart raced because I was anxious (which I am too lol). It never occurred to me that I could have a weak heart. I loved to bike, swim, run, jump, and dance, so how could I ever give up what I love? The truth is that I couldn't. I still love to do all those things, and I would like to keep being able to do those things until I am utterly incapable of moving! Is this crazy? Haha, my multiple conversations with myself all point to yes, but the joy I feel is incomparable and unlike anything else I have experienced.</p>
        <p>An experience that particularly made me want to code was the first time I used VR (virtual reality headset). At that point in my life, I was unable to feed myself, bathe myself, or leave my bed without the risk of fainting or losing bloodflow to my brain and vision. I had completely given up on being able to dance or sing, much less anything else that made me happy, but I could still boot up a computer, and what is a virtual reality headset, but a computer on my head! I wasn't expecting much, but I cried very hard when I opened up the built-in world. I was standing in a house on the mountain tops, a sight that I had fully given up on seeing ever again after I lost the ability to walk. What's the first thing I did after that? I climbed, I ran, and I danced! It was all virtual, so while playing was intense on my eyes and arms, I had never felt so complete and happy.</p>
        <p>I wanted to share this joy with other people. I wanted to create worlds where anyone could live the life they wanted, even if they were limited by reality. To bring a bit of joy and peace to someone who felt like I did. All of that begins with coding, eventually design, and always creativity. It's an ambitious goal that I often find myself afraid of giving up on, but like with many things in my life, they're only ever on pause and ready for me to pick up any time I'm ready. I'm so excited to be here and I hope that this is a dream that never dies no matter how much difficulty I face in the future. That is also why I want to leave myself a message here:</p>

        <h3>Dear Alchemy,</h3>
          <blockquote>I am so sorry for all the heartbreak. I am so sorry that you became so afraid of the world that you accepted the idea of a life where you never leave your bedroom. I am so sorry that you've been let down time and time again. But thank you for never giving up anyway. I know there have been more times than you can count where you wanted to throw everything away, from your name, the air you breathe, and the memories you've left behind, but I am so glad that you're here and that you still want to build a life for yourself, even if there's no one by your side in the end. I am so proud of you. I will be with you every step of the way. We can be crazy and talk to ourselves. We can sing songs until your throat is raw. We can achieve our goals, and I promise that we will. We've never been the fastest, always just right on time, so I promise that we will see this through too. There's no need to rush, so please do things that make you happy and feel alive, make memories, cry for days and months if you need, live your life because this website (a simple little project you started on a whim) will always be here. I believe in you! I love you! May lady luck always be on your side.</blockquote>
